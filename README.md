# Algorithms-And-DataStructures
My interview codebook

The repo consists of some <strong>must known</strong> interview questions.
It's a really good foundation for all technical interviews.


I have worked on both Python and C++, you can find the implementations below:
* [Python](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/Python)
* [C++](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/C%2B%2B)
* [LeetCode](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/LeetCode)
* [Data_Structures_And_Algorithms_UC-SanDiego](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms-UC_SanDiego)
* [Extra](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/Extra)

The <strong>Data_Structures_And_Algorithms_UC-SanDiego</strong> folder consists of learning materials, coding exercises and my personal progress on the classic Coursera course.

The <strong>LeetCode</strong> folder includes my solutions and their Unit Test of LeetCode coding problems.

The <strong>Python and C++</strong> folders are deprecated, but they include interesting solutions of CS 101 level problems.

The <strong>Extra</strong> folder consists of different online challenges.

<strong>TODO:</strong>
* Prioritize the LeetCode folder depending on the level of difficutly of each problem.
* Write a main README file for the Data_Structures_And_Algorithms_UC-SanDiego folder
