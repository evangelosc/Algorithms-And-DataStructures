# Algorithms-And-DataStructures
My interview codebook

The repo consists of some <strong>must known</strong> interview questions.
It's a really good foundation for all technical interviews.


I have worked on both Python and C++, you can find the implementations below:
* [Python](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/Python)
* [C++](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/C%2B%2B)
* [LeetCode](https://github.com/evangelosc/Algorithms-And-DataStructures/tree/master/LeetCode)

The majority of my implementations are solutions of leetcode problems.
I haven't so far associated each solution with the number of each problem.

The <strong>LeetCode</strong> folder includes both Python and C++ solutions to LeetCode problems. You can see the number of each question for easy navigation.
